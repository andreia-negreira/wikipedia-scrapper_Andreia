# Wikipedia Scrapper Project

## Description

The goal of this project is to implement concepts of scraping, data structures, regular expressions, concurrency and file handling while retrieving information from an API.

When running the main.py a list of countries and their past leaders  will be retrieved from Wikipedia, the information is then sanitized to a short bio in json format and finally saved in a separated file that can be accessed in the disk.

## Installation and Usage

1. Create an environment in order to install all the required modules;
2. With an activated environment, run this command in the terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt;
3. Run the main.py in a Python environment;
4. The information will start to be retrieved;
5. Check the dictionary in the new document leaders.json;
6. To format the document click on right side of your mouse and select "Format Document".
